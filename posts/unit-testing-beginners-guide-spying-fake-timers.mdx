Before we start, and if you are not familiar with Jest testing basics already, please make sure to cover the first part of this series, on [testing functions with Jest](unit-testing-beginners-guide-testing-functions).

Expanding on the previous tutorial, please make sure that you've created the `unit-testing-functions` directory and you have all the needed dependencies installed( NodeJS & Jest ).

The examples we've seen so far are very basic: a function taking some arguments , computing a result and returning it.
This makes unit testing a breeze since you just need to call it and assert the result.

Unfortunately, in real life, things are not that simple. There are many examples of functions that perform so called side-effects, making the unit testing process a little bit more complicated: functions setting up timers, calling HTTP end-points, DOM access, writing to disk etc.

Fortunately, there are techniques in place for pretty much all of these cases.

### Testing functions which involve the use of timers

We will be creating a function that given a time in seconds will begin counting down.
At each step it will invoke a progress callback function.
When the countdown is over a done callback will be called once at the end.

Let's start by creating a new file to hold our testing code `touch timer.js` .

Add the following code in it:

```js
function countdown(time, progressCallback, doneCallback) {
    progressCallback(time);
    setTimeout(function () {
        if (time > 1) {
            countdown(time - 1, progressCallback, doneCallback);
        } else {
            doneCallback();
        }
    }, 1000);
}

module.exports = countdown;
```

So , how would you test this ? Let's make a first attempt at it.

Create the spec file `touch timer.spec.js` and add the following content in it:

```js
const countdown = require("./timer.js");

describe("timer suite", function () {
    test("Should call the done callback when the timer has finished counting", function () {
        countdown(
            1,
            function (currentTime) {
                console.log(
                    "Progress callback invoked with time " + currentTime
                );
            },
            function () {
                console.log("Done callback invoked");
            }
        );
    });
});
```

We are just calling the `countdown` function and log whenever the progress callback is called
or when the done callback is called.

Run the tests at this point: `npm run test`. You will see an output similar to:

```js
PASS  ./timer.spec.js
  ● Console

    console.log timer.spec.js:6
      Progress callback invoked with time 1
```

**The test passed apparently and so what's all this fuss about ?**

Well, if you take a closer look, notice 2 things:

-   We didn't performed any assertions
-   The done callback was not called(nothing logged) even tough we gave it only 1 second time to count.

What it actually did happen is that, since no assertions were present in the test, there isn't anything to verify the function behavior and throw errors in case it's incorrect.
Since no error was thrown, Jest assumes the test is _successful_.

Which is not necessarily the case... Modify the code in `timer.js` to read like:

```js
function countdown(time, progressCallback, doneCallback) {
    progressCallback(time);
    setTimeout(function () {
        if (time > 1) {
            // countdown(time-1, progressCallback, doneCallback); <- We've commented out this part!
        } else {
            // doneCallback(); <- And this part also!!
        }
    }, 1000);
}

module.exports = countdown;
```

Re-run the tests and ... surprise ... the test is still passing.

So it seems our test, in it's current form, it's not more useful that complete lack of tests.

And it's not the test runner fault also: even if you use Mocha, Jasmine, Ava or whatever other test runner it's not possible for it to verify a behavior in the absence of _assertions_ .

During my development career, I've found, many times, instances we're developers, including I, were fooled by these kinds of behavior: thinking they have a strong battery of tests for a certain area , when in fact, many of them were testing nothing.

##### Quick tip

> Whenever writing tests verify it does actually do what is supposed to, by fiddling with the code under test.

> Modify it a little bit so that the test should fail and change it back and ensures it passes.

Now, revert back the commented code and let's start with a basic question:

**What we should verify(assert) regarding this code ?**

The description of the countdown function says it all:

-   progress callback should be called at each 1 second step
-   done callback should be called at the very end

With that out of the way how do we assert that ?

### Using spies

We use spies, well, to ... "spy" on the behavior of a function.

Quoting from the [Jest docs](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/mock-function-api.html#content) on spies:

> Mock functions are also known as "spies", because they let you spy on the behavior of a function that is called indirectly by some other code, rather than just testing the output. You can create a mock function with `jest.fn()`.

Simply put, a spy is another _function_ that has built-in the ability to record the details of the calls made to it: how many times it was called, with what arguments.

This is super convenient for us since both of the assertions we need to make must verify that 2 callback functions were called.

Let's put the "spy" to work by changing the code in `timer.spec.js` to read as:

```js
const countdown = require("./timer.js");

describe("timer suite", function () {
    test("Should call the done callback when the timer has finished counting", function () {
        const progressCallbackSpy = jest.fn();
        const doneCallbackSpy = jest.fn();

        countdown(1, progressCallbackSpy, doneCallbackSpy);
    });
});
```

What we just did is that we've created 2 "self-recording", spy functions. They are functions that don't do anything but know how to record the calls made to themselves if any.

Re-run the tests. The _tests are still passing_...

This is because Jest doesn't know we are dealing with an asynchronous test and that the `countdown` function performs an activity that spans asynchronously over time.

In these cases we can hint at Jest that we are dealing with asynchronous behavior , letting it know
that it must wait a while for the test to complete, before moving on and executing the next test.

Modify the `timer.spec.js` to read as:

```js
const countdown = require("./timer.js");

describe("timer suite", function () {
    test("Should call the done callback when the timer has finished counting", function (done) {
        const progressCallbackSpy = jest.fn();
        const doneCallbackSpy = jest.fn();

        countdown(1, progressCallbackSpy, doneCallbackSpy);
    });
});
```

Notice the part that reads as `function(done)` , where we told Jest it is dealing with an async test. Run the test at this point, and after a few seconds, you should see:

```js
FAIL  ./timer.spec.js (5.185s)
  ● timer suite › Should call the done callback when the timer has finished counting

    Timeout - Async callback was not invoked within timeout specified by jasmine.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL.

      at pTimeout (node_modules/jest-jasmine2/build/queueRunner.js:53:21)
      at Timeout.callback [as _onTimeout] (node_modules/jsdom/lib/jsdom/browser/Window.js:523:19)
      at tryOnTimeout (timers.js:232:11)
      at Timer.listOnTimeout (timers.js:202:5)
```

Finally, a test failure. But it's not exactly the failure we were expecting... The test error says

> Timeout - Async callback was not invoked within timeout specified by jasmine.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL.

What does actually means is that Jest had expect us to call the async callback to signal the end of the async tests but we didn't. And by
async callback it means the `done` callback declared as part of the test `function(done)` .

**So what's up with this `done` param ?**

-   `done` it's a _function_
-   It's injected by Jest into each an every test
-   When it's declared as part of the test function( as we did) it signals to Jest that the test is asynchronous. In this case Jest expects the programmer to _call_ this function to signal the end of the test.

**That said, how can we make the tests pass again ?**

Just add a call to `done` and we're... done

```js
const countdown = require("./timer.js");

describe("timer suite", function () {
    test("Should call the done callback when the timer has finished counting", function (done) {
        const progressCallbackSpy = jest.fn();
        const doneCallbackSpy = jest.fn();

        countdown(1, progressCallbackSpy, doneCallbackSpy);
        done(); // <- When this is called, we tell Jest the test is over!
    });
});
```

Run the test again and observe they pass.

But, if we look closely, we're back to square 1. The unit tests pass even when they should not, even with all the "spy" and async callback thing.

The problem is that _we should not_ call `done` where we are currently doing it. The test is done only when 1 second has passed, not _immediately_ after calling the `countdown` function.

So, how do we wait for 1 second to pass and _then_ call `done` ?

One approach is to call done only when `doneCallbackSpy` is invoked.
If it isn't, due to a bug or something else, then the test will timeout and eventually fail, which is what we expect.

Change again `timer.spec.js` to read as

```js
const countdown = require("./timer.js");

describe("timer suite", function () {
    test("Should call the done callback when the timer has finished counting", function (done) {
        const progressCallbackSpy = jest.fn();
        const doneCallbackSpy = jest.fn(function () {
            console.log("Done spy invoked");
            done();
        });

        countdown(1, progressCallbackSpy, doneCallbackSpy);
    });
});
```

Let's laser focus on

```js
const doneCallbackSpy = jest.fn(function () {
    console.log("Done spy invoked");
    done();
});
```

I told you that `jest.fn()` creates a function, that, when called, it doesn't do anything.

But when it is used like `jest.fn(replacementFunction)` it creates a function, that, when called it invokes the `replacementFunction`.

Of course, it still retains the basic characteristics of a spy, namely to record the return function usage.

The `jest.fn(replacementFunction)` is what allows us to supply a function to the spy and , when invoked, to call the `done` callback.

Run the test again, and noticed it passed.

Check we are not fooling ourselves, by modifying the code in `timer.js` and comment out the part that invoked the callback:

```js
if (time > 1) {
    countdown(time - 1, progressCallback, doneCallback);
} else {
    // doneCallback();
}
```

Run the tests, wait a few secs and observe the test is now failing. This is because the `done` callback is never invoked.

So we are actually testing something right now. Revert the commented code.

There is one more thing left to test - the progress callback.

For this, we can put another assertion within the countdown done callback and verify that progress callback was called and also assert how many times it should have been called.

```js
const countdown = require("./timer.js");

describe("timer suite", function () {
    test("Should call the done callback when the timer has finished counting", function (done) {
        const progressCallbackSpy = jest.fn();
        const doneCallbackSpy = jest.fn(function () {
            expect(progressCallbackSpy.mock.calls.length).toBe(1); // <= How many times it was called
            const firstCall = progressCallbackSpy.mock.calls[0];
            const firstCallArg = firstCall[0];
            expect(firstCallArg).toBe(1); // <= first param, of the first call,  is number 1
            done();
        });

        countdown(1, progressCallbackSpy, doneCallbackSpy);
    });
});
```

The key here is the `mockFn.mock.calls` part( https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/mock-function-api.html#mockfnmockcalls ).

It gives us an array, with one element per each call made to the function. Each call info is an array with the arguments of the call.

We are asserting 2 things:

1. `expect(progressCallbackSpy.mock.calls.length).toBe(1);` - progress callback has been invoked only once
2. `expect(firstCallArg).toBe(1);` - the argument of the progress callback is the remaining time to count

All seems good. Let's add a second unit test.

Add this to `timer.spec.js`

```js
test("Should call the done callback when the timer has finished counting and the countdown is 4 secs", function (done) {
    const progressCallbackSpy = jest.fn();
    const doneCallbackSpy = jest.fn(function () {
        expect(progressCallbackSpy.mock.calls.length).toBe(4);
        done();
    });

    countdown(4, progressCallbackSpy, doneCallbackSpy);
});
```

Run the tests.

Observe how the time it took for the unit tests to finish **increased with approx. 4 secs**.

This is not good... What if instead of 4 secs the countdown would have been of 1000 secs ?

What we really need is to put the time on "fast-forward".

### Manipulating time in unit tests

For this , we can use the powerful [timer mocks](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/jest-object.html#jestusefaketimers) in Jest:

```js
jest.useFakeTimers();
```

This replaces the _real_ `setTimeout`, `setInterval` etc functions with other functions that allows us to fast forward time.

Let's begin by enabling fake timers in `timer.spec.js`:

Just after the `require` section add the following line:

```js
const countdown = require("./timer.js");

jest.useFakeTimers(); // <= This mocks out any call to setTimeout, setInterval with dummy functions
```

Next, let's modify the tests and 'fast-forward' time , using `jest.runTimersToTime(msToRun)`(https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/jest-object.html#jestruntimerstotimemstorun):

```js
test("Should call the done callback when the timer has finished counting", function () {
    const progressCallbackSpy = jest.fn();
    const doneCallbackSpy = jest.fn();
    countdown(1, progressCallbackSpy, doneCallbackSpy);

    jest.runTimersToTime(1000); // <= Move the time ahead with 1 second

    expect(progressCallbackSpy.mock.calls.length).toBe(1);
    const firstCall = progressCallbackSpy.mock.calls[0];
    const firstCallArg = firstCall[0];
    expect(firstCallArg).toBe(1);
});

test("Should call the done callback when the timer has finished counting and the countdown is 4 secs", function () {
    const progressCallbackSpy = jest.fn();
    const doneCallbackSpy = jest.fn();

    countdown(4, progressCallbackSpy, doneCallbackSpy);

    jest.runTimersToTime(4000); // <= Move the time ahead with 4 seconds

    expect(progressCallbackSpy.mock.calls.length).toBe(4);
});
```

A few comments:

-   We removed the `done` callback as the test is no longer async( we mocked `setTimeout` with `jest.useFakeTimers()` call)
-   We made the done spy a function that doesn't do anything `const doneCallbackSpy = jest.fn();`
-   We are invoking the `countdown` function and 'fast-forward' the time with 1 second/4 seconds `jest.runTimersToTime(1000);`
-   We are making the assertions right after that since we don't need to wait anymore for the time to pass before being able to assert

Now the tests run much faster and they're also more reliable!

That concludes the 'spying' and testing time related functions tutorial.

Stay tuned for the next parts of the series, introducing more advanced techniques to mocking and testing XHR requests & DOM access.

I would love to hear from you in the comments regarding your experience with testing this kind of code!
