Follow along to see how you can setup VSCode debugging together with Jest to get breakpoints,
step through and all the other goodies you would expect when debugging a piece of code."

Lately I've been using a lot [Jest](http://facebook.github.io/jest/) as a unit testing runner. It's great because it allows me to do:

-   snapshot testing which makes updating unit tests a breeze
-   runs tests in parallel so it's super fast
-   has a nice command line app allowing me to filter the tests i want to run
-   built-in code coverage reports

In general i can manage debugging failing tests using just the built in test report
in Jest and occasionaly sprinkle some `console.log` statements for the expressions I want to inspect.

But there are situations in which a full fledged debugging environment is needed in order to figure
out what happens with my Jest tests.

If you are a fan of VSCode , like I'm, you can set it up very simple:

-   Open up `launch.json` file ( CTRL + SHIFT+P -> type `launch.json` )
-   Create a new configuration

```tsx
// launch.json
"configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Jest", // This is the configuration name you will see in debug sidebar
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "port": 5858,
            "address": "localhost",
            "stopOnEntry": false,
            "runtimeExecutable": null,
            "env": {
                "NODE_ENV": "production" // You can setup here any env vars you
            },
            "runtimeArgs": [
                "--debug-brk",
                "./node_modules/.bin/jest", // Path to Jest
                "-i"
            ],
            "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}"
        }
    ]
```

Please not that this config will work if you're using **Node 6.x**.

For **Node 7.x** , **8.x** you will need to use `--inspect-brk` instead of `debug-brk` .

Also , if you transpile your unit tests, eg using `Babel` or `TypeScript` you will need to ensure VSCode finds the source maps for the transformation, otherwise it will not react to breakpoints.

You can do that by defining `"sourceMaps": true` to the above configuration.

Even if it doesn't, and you can't setup source maps, you can still use a `debugger` statement in code to trigger the breakpoint you want and then step throught as usual.

To run the debugger just hit `F5` . Enjoy!
