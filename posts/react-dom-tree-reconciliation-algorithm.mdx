If you wanna learn about ReactJS virtual DOM reconciliation there's probably no better way than actually building it yourself.

**Please [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jstweetster) as I announce when new parts and videos are being published!**

Before moving forward make sure you've read the [intro to the series](/post/learning-react-from-inside-out-course-intro) and the previous post on [ReactJS clone - Creating DOM elements](/post/implementing-react-render-method)

### React virtual DOM re-conciliation

**Reconciliation** in React is the process in which the real DOM is brought in line with the virtual DOM.

By reconciliation React figures out only the needed changes(the difference) that needs to be applied to the current DOM structure to make it identical to the virtual DOM.

### A small change to the virtual DOM object

Before we begin with re-concilation algorithm there is a thing we need to change regarding our virtual DOM structure to bring it in line with React.

As discussed in section [React and the Virtual DOM](/post/react-and-virtual-dom) the current virtual DOM structure we're working with is:

```js
const virtualDOM = {
  type: "div",
  props: { id: "id1", class: "abc" },
  children: [
    {
      type: "div",
      props: { class: "child" },
      children: [],
    },
  ],
};
```

We will be changing it so that the **children** key is part of the `props` object:

```js
const virtualDOM = {
  type: "div",
  props: {
    id: "id1",
    class: "abc",
    children: [
      {
        type: "div",
        props: { class: "child" },
        children: [],
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

### This part goals

In this part our end goal is to get the following code working properly without it having to fully re-create the real DOM each time:

```js
const virtualDOM = {
  type: "div",
  props: { id: "id1", class: "abc" },
  children: [
    {
      type: "div",
      props: { class: "child" },
      children: [],
    },
  ],
};
const anotherVirtualDOM = {
  type: "div",
  props: { id: "id2", class: "xyz abc" },
  children: [
    {
      type: "p",
      props: { class: "child" },
      children: [],
    },
  ],
};
render(virtualDOM, document.getElementById("app"));
render(anotherVirtualDOM, document.getElementById("app"));
```

Notice how between the 2 renders, the root `div` changes it's id and gets an additional class added.

Also the child `div` is transformed into a `p` tag.

We need to create an algorithm capable of identifying what has changed between 2 virtual trees and output that information as a _list of changes_.

That list of changes is then used by the `render` function in `react-dom.js` file to figure out how it should update the real DOM.

Also `render` would need to know on which real DOM node the changes will need to be performed.

### Refactoring the DOM elements creation

Up until now we've added support for rendering, based on an VDOM object a real DOM node.

Let's begin by refactoring the current code and start adding support to update the DOM based on a `change` object that contains the instructions on **how to update the DOM**.

In `react-dom.js` start by adding a new, internal function, called `updateDOM` that looks somewhat like this:

```js
const updateDOM = (change) => {};
```

Also, the `render` method needs to change so that:

1. It hands off the current virtual DOM and the next virtual DOM to a function capable of figuring out the differences between the 2 virtual DOMs
2. For each change detected at step 1) it defers updating the DOM to the `updateDOM` function. This is needed so we can support multiple types of updates not just creating new DOM elements

To do that we will be introducing a new variable that holds the current virtual DOM.

At the top of the `react-dom.js` file add:

```js
// We will be mutating this variable. It starts out as null
let currentVirtualDOM = null;
```

Then change the `render` method to look something like:

```js
const render = (nextVirtualDOM, node) => {
  if (!currentVirtualDOM) {
    // This is the first render ever, empty the node container before rendering
    node.innnerHTML = null;
  }
  // Detect the changes between the 2 virtual DOM trees
  const changes = virtualDOMDiff(currentVirtualDOM, nextVirtualDOM, node);
  // For each change update the REAL DOM
  changes.forEach(updateDOM);
  // Make the next virtual DOM the current one
  currentVirtualDOM = nextVirtualDOM;
};
```

I believe the inline comments are pretty self-explanatory. Don't worry if it's not yet clear how `virtualDOMDiff` is implemented or how `updateDOM` works.

### Types of DOM operations

Let's identify first which are the DOM operations that we could perform.

1. Add new DOM nodes

When a certain node is missing from the old virtual DOM but it's present in the new one it should be created.

The change should obviously specify the type, the virtual DOM object and the parent node into which the newly created node will be inserted(`domContextNode`)

```js
{ type: 'create-node', vdom: virtualDOMNode, domContextNode }
```

2. Remove node

Whenever a node was present in the old virtual DOM but is nowhere to be found in the new virtual DOM, then it must be removed from the real DOM.

The event should at the very minimum specify the type, the DOM node to be removed(`node` property) and the parent of the node to be removed(`domContextNode` property)

```js
{
  type: "remove-node", node, domContextNode;
}
```

3. Adding and updating props prop

When a virtual DOM node contains a prop that is not present on the same node from the old virtual DOM.
Or when the property value has changed between 2 renders.

At minimum it would contain the `type`, the name of the prop added or updated(`prop`), the new value of the prop(`value`) and the node on which the property
should be set or updated(`domContextNode`).

```js
{type: 'change-prop', prop: 'name', value: 'prop value', domContextNode }
```

3. Removing a prop

When a prop does exist in an old virtual DOM but it does not exist on the new one
the property needs to be removed from DOM.

At a minimum the change should contain the `type`, the name of the property to be removed(`prop` field) and the DOM node from which the property should be removed(`domContextNode` field).

```js
{type: 'remove-prop', prop: 'name' domContextNode }
```

That pretty much covers it.

### Processing changes

Now that we have defined the possible type of DOM changes it's time to actually code a function that takes in a change and applies it to the real DOM.

Just _assume_ that the change objects are generated already for now. We will be coding that part shortly.

Let's code the `updateDOM` function to handle all these changes:

```js
const updateDOM = (change) => {
  switch (change.type) {
    case "create-node":
      change.domContextNode.appendChild(createDOMElement(change.vdom));
      break;
    case "remove-node":
      change.domContextNode.removeChild(change.node);
      break;
    case "change-prop":
      change.domContextNode.setAttribute(change.prop, change.value);
      break;
    case "remove-prop":
      change.domContextNode.removeAttribute(change.prop);
      break;
    default:
      break;
  }
};
```

So for each type of change we apply the changes to the real DOM using the regular DOM API.

### Figuring out changes between two virtual DOMs

Now that we have a function capable of actually applying a change to the real DOM
is time to actually generate the list of changes.

We will delegate this responsability to a function named `virtualDOMDiff`.

The `virtualDOMDiff` function will act as an aggregator of all of the detected changes.

It's also probably a good time to put this re-conciliation logic into it's own file.

So go ahead and create a `dom-reconciliation.js` file and put the definition of `virtualDOMDiff` in it:

**File: dom-reconciliation.js**

```js
const virtualDOMDiff = (virtualDOM, anotherVirtualDOM) => {
  const differences = [];
  // In here goes the diffing between virtualDOM and anotherVirtualDOM
  return differences;
};
```

The function takes in the 2 virtual DOMs it needs to compare and outputs a list(an array) of changes between the 2 trees.

A _change_ should be able to fully describe an operation that needs to be performed
on a current DOM element so it is brought in line with the latest virtual DOM.

There are 3 broad categories of things that can change between 2 virtual DOMs:

1. Tag changes
2. Detecting changed props
3. Children changes

In the spirit of **Single Responsibility Principle**, we will be creating a function to deal with each of these type of changes.

### Conclusion and next steps

We need to get smarted about hitting the real DOM each and every time the virtual DOM is updated.

As such we've began creating a smarter algorithm capable of surgically applying DOM changes based on the differences in virtual DOMs.

Next we will be implementing the part of the algorithm capable of detecting when a tag type has changed in any branch of the virtual DOM tree.
