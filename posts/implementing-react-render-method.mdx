Make sure you've read [part 1](/post/react-and-virtual-dom/) before tackling this one. It's really important that it's clear to you how the virtual DOM data structure looks like.

### Sketching up react-dom file

Open up `react-dom.js` file and you should have the following contents:

```js
export const render = (virtualDOM, node) => {};
```

The goal of the render is to alter the contents of the `node` DOM container and make sure it accurately reflects the `virtualDOM` description.

Let's see how we would alter the contents of the `node`:

```js
export const render = (virtualDOM, node) => {
  node.innerHTML = "Hello world";
};
```

Awesome! It's just we haven't used `virtualDOM` yet :)

As a reminder this is how the `virtualDOM` looks like so far:

```js
const element = {
  type: "div",
  props: { id: "abc", class: "awesome" },
  children: [
    {
      // This is the secondDiv object from above
      type: "div",
      props: { id: "column-1", class: "column" },
      children: ["Hi"],
    },
  ],
};
```

### Create REAL DOM elements from virtual DOM

Let's define, in `react-dom.js` file an internal, private function, for turning a virtual DOM element into a DOM node.

Let's call it `createDOMElement`.

It will accept a JSON object that looks like:

```js
{ type: 'div', props: { .... }, children: [... ]}
```

It will output 1(one) single a real DOM node.

So this is what we'll currently have in `react-dom.js` file.

```js
const createDOMElement = (virtualDOMElement) => {};

export const render = (virtualDOM, node) => {
  node.appendChild(createDOMElement(virtualDOM));
};
```

As you can see `render` just defers the creation of the real DOM from virtual DOM to the `createDOMElement` method.

Then it takes the real DOM node returned by `createDOMElement` and appends it to the container as a child.

Don't worry about the implementation details of `createDOMElement` , we'll begin implementing it very soon!

### Implementing createDOMElement

For brevity all the code examples in the section refer to the `react-dom.js` file and more specifically the `createDOMElement` function.
I'll be omitting for now the `render` function from the code listing.

The first thing we need to be able is to be able to create a tag node programatically.

### Creating an element for a certain tag

It turns out there is a handy DOM method for creating elements programatically, in the form of `document.createElement`:

```js
const createDOMElement = (virtualDOMElement) => {
  const element = document.createElement(virtualDOMElement.type);

  return element;
};
```

### Setting tag attributes

Surprinsingly, there is another DOM API for that `element.setAttribute(name, value)`:

```js
const createDOMElement = (virtualDOMElement) => {
  const element = document.createElement(virtualDOMElement.type);
  Object.keys(virtualDOMElement.props).forEach((attrName) => {
    element.setAttribute(attrName, virtualDOMElement.props[attrName]);
  });

  return element;
};
```

We are just iterating over the keys in `virtualDOMElement.props`. The jey names is the name of the DOM element attribute while the value is... the value of that attribute.

### Setting up children

The plan is simple: for each child in the virtual DOM children create a real DOM child and append it to the current element.

This is how it looks like:

```js
const createDOMElement = (virtualDOMElement) => {
  const element = document.createElement(virtualDOMElement.type);
  Object.keys(virtualDOMElement.props).forEach((attrName) => {
    element.setAttribute(attrName, virtualDOMElement.props[attrName]);
  });
  virtualDOMElement.children.forEach((virtualDOMElem) => {
    element.appendChild(createDOMElement(virtualDOMElem));
  });
  return element;
};
```

### Handling text nodes

The above code is fine but it has a glitch. Given our initial virtual DOM:

```js
const virtualDOM = {
  type: "div",
  props: { id: "abc", class: "awesome" },
  children: [
    {
      type: "div",
      props: { id: "abc", class: "awesome" },
      children: ["Hi"],
    },
  ],
};
```

**Notice the part `children: ["Hi"]`**.

Trying to call `createDOMElement("Hi")` isn't going to end up well.

And we get there because of the way we are building the child nodes:

```js
virtualDOMElement.children.forEach((virtualDOMElem) => {
  element.appendChild(createDOMElement(virtualDOMElem));
});
```

When one of the `children` is a string, like in the case above, we need to properly handle that.

The DOM API offers us a way to create text nodes by using `document.createTextNode(string)`.

This is the revised code:

```js
const createDOMElement = (virtualDOMElement) => {
  if (typeof virtualDOMElement === "string") {
    return document.createTextNode(virtualDOMElement);
  }
  const element = document.createElement(virtualDOMElement.type);
  Object.keys(virtualDOMElement.props).forEach((attrName) => {
    element.setAttribute(attrName, virtualDOMElement.props[attrName]);
  });
  virtualDOMElement.children.forEach((virtualDOMElem) => {
    element.appendChild(createDOMElement(virtualDOMElem));
  });
  return element;
};
```

So if `virtualDOMElement` is a string we just call the `document.createTextNode` API and return the created node.

Otherwise, if it's a child tag, we follow the normal flow and recursively create the tag, set the attributes and process the children of the node.

### Putting it all together

In `react-dom.js` you should have the following:

```js
const createDOMElement = (virtualDOMElement) => {
  if (typeof virtualDOMElement === "string") {
    return document.createTextNode(virtualDOMElement);
  }
  const element = document.createElement(virtualDOMElement.type);
  Object.keys(virtualDOMElement.props).forEach((attrName) => {
    element.setAttribute(attrName, virtualDOMElement.props[attrName]);
  });
  virtualDOMElement.children.forEach((virtualDOMElem) => {
    element.appendChild(createDOMElement(virtualDOMElem));
  });
  return element;
};

export const render = (virtualDOM, node) => {
  node.appendChild(createDOMElement(virtualDOM));
};
```

In `index.js` , where we actually kick things off, let's say we have the following code:

```js
import { render } from "./react-dom";
const virtualDOM = {
  type: "div",
  props: { id: "abc", class: "awesome" },
  children: [
    {
      type: "div",
      props: { id: "abc", class: "awesome" },
      children: ["Hi"],
    },
  ],
};

render(virtualDOM, document.getElementById("app"));
```

By running the code above in the browser you should see the full DOM structure by inspecting the page and the text `Hi` on the screen.

### Next steps

As you've probably figured out, this is concerned just with creating the DOM structure.

The next thing we wanna tackle it to support diffing between 2 virtual DOM structures.

So basically let's make the following code work properly:

```js
render(virtualDOM, document.getElementById("app"));
render(anotherVirtualDOM, document.getElementById("app"));
```

By rendering 2 virtual DOMs into the same container, ideally we would like to avoid re-rendering the whole thing and just do a diff between the virtual DOMs and update with that.
