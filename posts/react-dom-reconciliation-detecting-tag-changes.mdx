title: "Part 4 - ReactJS clone reconciliation - Detecting changed tags"
tags: ["Learning React from inside out", "react series"]
summary: "Now it's time to step it up a little bit and add some intelligence to the rendering algoritm. Instead of blindly re-creating the DOM each time, it will become smarter and apply only the changes that are different"

Welcome back folks! If you didn't yet followed the series, as a reminder we are building a ReactJS clone library for the purpose of **deeply understanding React from the ground up**.

Make sure you've read the [intro to the series](/post/learning-react-from-inside-out-course-intro) and the previous post on [ReactJS clone reconciliation algorithm](/post/react-dom-tree-reconciliation-algorithm)

### What kind of tag changes do we detect

There are a few cases to consider here:

1. If the current virtual DOM is null, create everything from scratch
2. If the next virtual DOM is null, then delete the associated DOM node.
3. If the tag has changed re-create and replace the whole DOM sub-tree from scratch
4. If the Node is a text node and it's contents has changed, re-create it and replace it from scratch

Let's define a function dedicated to figuring out tag changes.

**File: dom-reconciliation.js**

```js
const detectTagChanges = (
  currentVirtualDOM,
  nextVirtualDOM,
  node,
  childIdx = 0
) => {
  const differences = [];
  // CASE 1 - If a new node was added, ie it was not present in the
  // old virtual DOM but is specified in the new one
  if (!currentVirtualDOM && nextVirtualDOM) {
    differences.push({
      type: "create-node",
      vdom: nextVirtualDOM,
      domContextNode: node,
    });
  }
  // CASE 2 - If the node was removed in the new virtual DOM but //  was present in the old one
  if (!nextVirtualDOM && currentVirtualDOM) {
    differences.push({
      type: "remove-node",
      vdom: nextVirtualDOM,
      domContextNode: node.childNodes[childIdx],
    });
  }

  // If both nodes are present but the tag has changed or the text node
  // contents has changed
  if (currentVirtualDOM && nextVirtualDOM) {
    // CASE 3 - Tag type changed
    const areDifferentTypes =
      typeof currentVirtualDOM === "object" &&
      typeof nextVirtualDOM === "object" &&
      currentVirtualDOM.type !== nextVirtualDOM.type;

    // CASE 4 - text node strings changed
    const areDifferentStrings =
      typeof currentVirtualDOM === "string" &&
      typeof nextVirtualDOM === "string" &&
      currentVirtualDOM !== nextVirtualDOM;

    if (areDifferentTypes || areDifferentStrings) {
      differences.push({
        type: "replace-node",
        domContextNode: node.childNodes[childIdx],
        vdom: nextVirtualDOM,
      });
    }
  }

  return differences;
};
```

With that in place it's time to update our `virtualDOMDiff` method:

```js
export const virtualDOMDiff = (
  currentVirtualDOM,
  nextVirtualDOM,
  node,
  childIdx
) => {
  const differences = [];

  differences.push(
    ...detectTagChanges(currentVirtualDOM, nextVirtualDOM, node, childIdx)
  );

  return differences;
};
```

### Next steps

Next will be adding code to support detecting both added/changed attributes(props) and deleted ones.
